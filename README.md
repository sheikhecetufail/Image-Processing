# Image-Processing

This project is related to the basic understanding of some of the core concepts of Image Processing. Here, some basic programs are uploaded. These programs are wriiten in MatLab. The main concepts which are implemented are:

1. Image conversions
2. Image resizing
3. Basic Point Transformations
4. Log and Power law Transformations
5. Bit Plane Slicing
6. Histogram Equalization
7. Contrast Stretching
8. Linear and Non-Linear Spatial Filtering
9. Sharpening Filters
10. Edge Detection using Prewitt, Sobel, Canny.
11. Segmentation using Global Thresholding via Automatic Thresholding

In future, I will be adding the concepts related to filtering in the frequency domain which includes Ideal, Butterworth and Gaussian Filters.
